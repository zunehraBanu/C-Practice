/*18. Write a C++ program to find the area of any triangle using Heron's formula.
Sample Output:
Find the area of any triangle using Heron's Formula :
----------------------------------------------------------
Input the length of 1st side of the triangle : 5
Input the length of 2nd side of the triangle : 5
Input the length of 3rd side of the triangle : 5
The area of the triangle is : 10.8253*/
